Hello! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm Sergio, professor of Design and Computation at Inteli - Institute of Technology and Leadership, where we train the future technology leaders of Brazil, preparing each of our students for the reality of the market, showing that technology and cutting-edge training are important and so is the human side of them.

Our methodology is focused on developing creative solutions to real market and to society challenges from day one. We combine teaching excellence with socio-emotional skills and entrepreneurship. And in addition to cutting-edge knowledge, Inteli students learn to work collaboratively and transform the world with creativity and intelligence.

Feel free to contact me or visit us in our campus in S√£o Paulo.
